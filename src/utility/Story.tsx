        The couch cushions deflated as Rinne deepened into a relaxed pose. His
        right hand grasped a TV remote while his left held his lazy cheek in
        place. It was a Saturday at noon; Crazy:B had no practice or events
        planned and Niki took advantage of this free time to pick up a full
        day’s shift at Cafe Cinnamon, leaving Rinne at his apartment to rot away
        at the sofa. He could hit up the nearby pachinko parlor, hang out with
        his roommates, or even bother HiMERU or Kohaku, but his sleepiness
        weighed down on him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overwhelming tiredness shouldn’t be a surprise to him, though. Rinne
        recently had started waking up before his early morning alarm, the pure
        exhilaration from starting a new day was enough to motivate him awake.
        This energy carried him through dance practice and other idol jobs, and
        he used the leftover energy to indulge in some pachinko when work ended
        in the evening. The gambler easily lost track of time and found himself
        at the parlor until midnight. It was a cycle; rinse and repeat every
        day.
      </p>

      <p>
        ... He deserved a rest day after all. All of the sleep debt he racked up
        finally came to bite him in the ass. Rinne’s left hand slowly shifted
        lower on his face, his watch fell down his wrist and his fingers lost
        grip of his sharp cheekbones. He didn’t fight it, he allowed his body to
        relax and let the TV anchor’s voice cradle him to sleep. His eyelids
        shut gracefully like draping curtains, hiding him away from the real
        world.
      </p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>
        Rinne’s groggy eyes were nonchalant when the door creaked open,
        revealing Niki carrying various grocery bags, containing fresh produce
        ready to be seasoned and cooked for a meal. Was it dinner time already?
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, Niki...” he croaked through his sleepiness. Rinne felt a wave of
        comfort knowing Niki arrived home from work safely, and allowed that
        feeling to drift him away back to sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        ... At least, he <em>thought</em> that was Niki.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rinne’s eyes woke up more, focused on who he originally assumed was his
        close friend. The familiar man had the same long ponytail as Niki, even
        placed over the same shoulder as his. However, unlike Niki’s ponytail
        that was sloppily tossed to one side, this man’s gray locks were neatly
        placed and caressed over his shoulder. While Niki’s overgrown bangs
        playfully tickled his nose, the clone’s bangs were carefully styled.
        Swept to the side, with care to highlight crucial facial features that
        Niki would otherwise disregard.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Rinne focused his eyes to get the man’s whole body in frame he
        noticed the clothes the seemingly familiar man was donning. This style
        was one Rinne always wanted to see his future husband wear and a wave of
        giddiness hit him now that the clothes were in front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        A warm, purple, half buttoned shirt playfully decorated with light polka
        dots giving a fashionably retro vibe. The shirt was neatly tucked into
        his black pants which were trimmed by a professional leather belt
        centered with a round, gold buckle. The parts of his upper body that
        would otherwise be revealed by the shirt’s styling was protected by a
        white undershirt with sleeves that bunched at his wrists. Only wearing a
        black t-shirt and jeans, Rinne was completely mesmerized. The more he
        looked, the more details he noticed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The model donned gold accessories, reflecting in Rinne’s aquamarine
        eyes, complimentary colors creating a hypnotizing swirl. Large, oval
        hoop earrings relaxed naturally with the stylish man’s warm complexion,
        balancing the cool tones of his frosty gray hair and sapphire eyes. A
        chain necklace emphasized by the white shirt as a backdrop, dangling off
        his neck effortlessly despite the weight of the metal. All of this
        finished off with various gold rings decorating his fingers. These
        accessories were the final pieces that completed the puzzle that is Niki
        Shiina.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Rinne couldn’t take his mind off of one glaring flaw, tainting
        this piece of art.
      </p>

      <p>That wasn’t Niki. Who the--</p>

      <p>
        “--hell are <em>you</em>...?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The harsh tone emerging from the unfamiliar man caught Rinne off guard,
        immediately turning on the leader’s defense instincts.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I could say the same to you!” Rinne refuted. “Bargin’ in and bein’ rude
        without even saying hello, who do you think you are?! Do you even live
        here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The stranger’s eyes went wide and his features distorted with offense.
        His likeness to Niki caused Rinne’s stomach to drop; he would never want
        to be the reason his best friend made that expression. Yet, he
        maintained a high guard as the imposter was ready to attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you talking about? This is <strong>MY</strong> house.”
      </p>

      <p>He took a short breath.</p>

      <p>“Well, it’s the house that I share with my brother, Niki...”</p>

      <p>
        The man at the door paused, eyes darting around searching for the man
        whose name he just uttered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Where is he? Did you do something to him?? I can call the police,
        y'know, tell them a stranger broke into my house!” He shot an accusatory
        finger at Rinne. “You better tell me where Niki is!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “WILL YA CALM DOWN?!” Rinne finally bolted up from the sofa to approach
        Niki’s alleged brother. “Niki’s at work! Nothing happened to him,
        okay?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        He blurted that out to stop the brother from panicking, but Rinne’s eyes
        narrowed and his brows furrowed once he realized something wasn’t right.
      </p>

      <p>
        “... He never mentioned having a brother, though,” the words slipped
        from his lips. Niki always enlightened Crazy:B with the many places he
        traveled to with his parents as a kid. These stories left Kohaku and
        Rinne himself feeling a pit in their hearts from wanderlust; a part of
        them wished they could explore the vast world just like Niki. However,
        nowhere in his words did the scatterbrained chef ever leave room for a
        brother to fit into the picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Niki’s nameless brother raised an eyebrow, curious about what Rinne just
        stated. “Oho, and who are you to say that? You think you know my own
        family better than me? You’re just a stranger.”
